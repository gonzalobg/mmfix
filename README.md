TODO:
- Add more tests:
  - https://github.com/rymrg/rocker/tree/popl21/examples
  - https://github.com/rymrg/rocker/tree/pldi19/examples/submission
  - Bridging the Gap between Programming Languages and Hardware Weak Memory Models
  - mp-release-sequence-store-and-external-store.litmus should not be accepted by rc11? need to talk with Ori
- Include new lb shapes (from LICM, MRD, ...)


# Differences between C++11 and RC11

In RC11, tests of the form:

```cpp
// Thread 0:
*y = 1;
atomic_store_explicit(x, 1, memory_order_release);
atomic_store_explicit(x, 3, memory_order_relaxed);

// Thread 1
int a = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_acquire);
if (a == 3)
  int b = *y;

// Thread 2
atomic_store_explicit(x, 2, memory_order_relaxed);
```

are well-defined (if `a == 3` then `b = 1`) since Thread 2 store does not break the release sequence headed by Thread 1 release store.

However, C++11 and C++14 state:

> A release sequence headed by a release operation A on an atomic object M is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side effects in the modification order of M, where the first operation is A, **and every subsequent operation is performed by the same thread that performed A**, or is an atomic read-modify-write operation.

We incorporate this into the [model/cpp11.cat](./model/cpp11.cat) as follows:

```diff
- let rs = [W]; (sb & loc)?; [W & (RLX | REL | ACQ_REL | ACQ | SC)]; (rf; myrmw)*
+ let rs = ([W]; (sb & loc)?; [W & (RLX | REL | ACQ_REL | ACQ | SC)]) \ (coe; coe); (rf; myrmw)*
```

Notice also that the comma after the high-lighted bold section above is load bearing.
As a consequence, the following test is not allowed by C++11 due to the read-modify-write breaking the release sequence:

```cpp
// Thread 0:
*y = 1;
atomic_store_explicit(x, 1, memory_order_release);
atomic_store_explicit(x, 3, memory_order_relaxed);

// Thread 1
int a = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_acquire);
if (a == 3)
  int b = *y;

// Thread 2
atomic_fetch_add_explicit(x, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
```

Furthermore, C++11 lacks the OOTA fix:

```diff
- acyclic (sb | rf) as no-thin-air
```
